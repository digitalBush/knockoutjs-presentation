Observables
	Observables tell you when they change. Talk about how they get auto-wired. Demo?
	- Standard
		Show syntax. Can be any type.
	- Arrays
		Show syntax. Wrapper around array. Notifies when contents of array changes.
	- Computed
		Composes multiple arrays. Talk about observable chaining.

Bindings
	Link observables (and objects) to the DOM. Two-way binding on observables.
	Go over basic bindings:
	- Appearance
	- Control Flow
	- Forms
	- Templating
		Talk about Jim's external templates

Integration
	Mapping plugin
	Custom bindings
	ToJSON

Rewriting some jQuery anti-patterns using binding and observables for fun and profit!
